Using DITA XML for standards
============================

by John Tait

This is the source of an article about using DITA XML to create procedure and policy documents (standards).

DITA is usually used to create product documentation or software user guides. This is for you if you write standards of any kind instead of those. It's intended for authors and decision-makers faced with (or considering) using DITA for both new documents and migrating legacy content.

It doesn't deal with any technical aspects because that information is widely available elsewhere. This mainly discusses the unique aspects for writing standards.

The source is itself DITA code. Please create a working copy for yourself if you like.

Files

I'm using the file extension .xml rather than .dita for the topic files to enable GitHub to present the files in a more readable way. I might switch in the future.
